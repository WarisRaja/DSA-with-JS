a= 45;
var a;           we can declare variable after using it i.e in above, but it bad practice.
                 And it is speciality of var only, not let
console.log(a)

we can not do this with let
it gives error

a =45;
let a;
console.log(a)

console.log("sum of "+a +"and "+ b +" is " + a+b);
it gives answer as concate as string : sum of 45and 10 is 4510

to get rid of this, we need to put bracket ()
console.log("sum of "+a +"and "+ b +" is " + (a+b));
but overall, answer is string.
console.log(a+b +"is sum of "+a +"and "+ b" );
 
Session 1:
Q. sum of two integer
Q. Relation between integer and string
Q. sum and message
-type coercion.

Q. Accept and print the answer
   we use prompt but it takes as string,so we need to convert into number by Number
+ Q. Swap two variables via 3 methods

-Operators and their questions
-Arithmetic -'+, -,*,%,'
   1 + 1  =2
   1 + "1"     =11
   1-1 =0
   1- "1"  =0  
   1* "30" =30 in all operators except +
-Relational operator - '>,

-logical operator - '&&, II'

-Unary operator - '++, "--"
note it gives error if u are using on number not variable
 ++45 //error
 --a //valid
 and for nesting also
 --(b--)  //error

Math functions
--Math.round()
--Math.ceil()
---Math.floor()
--Math trunc() // remove the decimal part
--Math.pow()
--Math.sqrt()
--Math.cbrt()
